# Propaganda Exploratory Data Analysis by the Russian telegram data

This repository contains the EDA results of propaganda by the Russian telegram channels from 2015 to 2023. 
We were interested in exploring the patterns generated by the list of 300+ channels to understand the presence and scale of Russian propaganda. 
TF-IDF approach is used to get a deeper insight into the message's context.

### Files description
The project consists of:<br>
  * `propaganda_eda.ipynb` - the main file with the EDA
  * `propaganda_TF_IDF.ipynb` - the file with TF-IDF data analysis
  * `propaganda_eda.pdf` - the formatted EDA report in *.pdf*
  * `propaganda_TF_IDF.pdf` - the formatted TF-IDF data analysis in *.pdf*
  * `requirements.txt` - the project dependencies
    
### How to run the project?
The project has many interactive graphs made with `plotly` framework that do not show in loaded *.ipynb* files. So we encourage you to run the project
by yourself to fully get the clarity of reports. <br>

0. create virtual env `python -m venv .venv`
1. activate virtual env `. .venv/bin/activate`
2. install dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
